Core Techniques


Ordered Index
ordered by chunk layer and offset of the chunk in the file, use a separate ID to indicate the order

Index Linearization
linearize the ordered index to separate linear index streams

Chunk Lookup and Chunk Cache
find all the effective chunks concerning frame n, and cache them, for they may still be effective to the next frame

Key Framing
generating of inter-mediate frames according to a key frame pair

Zlib Compression
use zlib to compress the pos_and_color of compressed chunks



Utility Techniques


File Cache
cache a piece of the file to speed up the I/O

Frame Cache
cache a sequence of generated TCAS frames to improve the overall performance



Obsolete Techniques


Threadpooling
use a threadpool to generate TCAS frames in parallels

Mapping of File
map the whole file into memory
