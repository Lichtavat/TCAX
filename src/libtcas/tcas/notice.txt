Note that, tcas lib does not check for null pointers as parameters.
IMPORTANT: encapsulation on Containers (Collectors), meaning that you can only use interface to access their data members. 
But this constraint is not for other data types (structs)

CONSTRAINTS: when writing the TCAS file, please make sure if startTime < endTime, do not write the chunk, 
if startTime == endTime and is not key frame chunks, do not write the chunk.

compacted index does not surport key framing.
