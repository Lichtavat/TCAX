Add _tcxlib_get_texts_pix

and add feature of getting text pix with minus border. (bord_inside = true)

-----------------------------------------------------

Add alternative version of function tcxlib_get_pix_from_texts function (that allow user to initialize the font one time) : Done

Add tcxPy_Fin in tcxPy.py module and in TCC file and check if there is memory leak : Done

Add functions for writing tcs and ass files, Tips: TCX_PyTcsFile = CreateTcsFile(filename, width, height, fps), Tcs Header and Tcs File is included in the TCX_PyTcsFile structure, WriteTcsFile(pyTcsFile, Tcs buf), EndTcsFile(pyTcsFile) - write the header to TCS file and close the TCS file : Done

need to check its validity : Done

TCX_PyAssFile = CreateAssFile(filename, header) create an ASS file and write header, WriteAssFile(PyAssFile, Ass buf), EndAssFile(PyAssFile) simply close the file : Done

-------------------------------------------------------

Add get texts metrics function : Done

------------------------------------------------------

The features list in the following is not so urgent at present:

Add get PIX from image (png) function : Done

Add functions for manipulating PIX structure : Done

------------------------------------------------------

Add tcs_main (receive the whole TCX PY PIX structure) function and image resizing method : Done

Add PixTexture and PixMask : Done

Should change all PyLong_AS_LONG to PyLong_AsLong and PyFloat_AS_DOUBLE to PyFloat_AsDouble because if the py object to be convert is not a long type PyLong_AS_LONG will return the wrong value so as the PyFloat_AS_DOUBLE : Done

Fix bug in tcxlib_get_pix_from_text : Done

Better support of png file : Done

-------------------------------------------------------

Add Gauss IIR blur : Done

Add tcs_fade : Done

Add PixColorShift PixColorMulti : Done

Add PixCrop : Done

-------------------------------------------------------------

Add PixColorTrans : Done

Add PixColorRGBA PixColorRGB PixColorA : Done

Add BilinearFilter : Done  (p.s. but there are still some problems to be dealt with (e.g., if there is only one pixel, then it will be only as bright as 1/4 of it's original, if the fps of the video and the fps of the FX doesn't match...--> this issue seems impossible to resolve)  : (   )

Add another version of CombinePixs that will simply make a single PIX that hold the two source PIXs which means create a container that holds the two PIXs but do not blend them:
PIX_C = CreatePixContainer(), PixContainerAdd(PIX_C, PIX, offset_x, offset_y, layer), PIX = PixContainerToPix(PIX_C), you can use Pix container to make a big PIX that allows you to handle a whole line in one PIX : Done

Update ConvertBigPix function to support `layer' : Done

Add Bezier Curve (the order is adjusted by the number of parameters)

Add VertTextPix (HoriTextPix is just the same as TextPix)

Keyframe animation...
